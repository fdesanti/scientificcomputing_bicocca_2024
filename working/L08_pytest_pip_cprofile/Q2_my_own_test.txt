For this exercise I implemented some unit tests and regression tests. 

The repository is available at https://github.com/fdesanti/HYPERION

The tests are in the /tests folder. 

I wrote a github action that runs them at every commit on the main branch and set up 
protection rules that prevents pushes on that branch if the tests fail
