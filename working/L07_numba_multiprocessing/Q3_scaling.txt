In this exercise I implemented a pseudo "match filtering" search, by computing the Optimal SNR 
of a set of CBCs. 
I parallelized with multiprocessing the generation of the waeveforms, fft and SNR computation.
We notice how the speedup scales almost linearly for n_cpus<=4 where we have the minimum runtime. 
After that the runtime remains stable and does not scale anymore, meaning that the overhead induced 
by the presence of additional workers is balanced with the computational gain from parallelization, 
therefore adding more CPUs no longer provides a net speedup.
